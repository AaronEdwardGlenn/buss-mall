        <h1>Help us by choosing your favorite products</h1>
<h2>Here's how the process works...</h2>

<article>Here we go! You will be shown 3 different images of different products available in our cateloge. Your goal is to pick your favorite of these three images. Once you have done this, a new set of three images will be displayed. You will see many objects more than once. After 25 sets of 3 objects where you have chosen your favorite, you are done!
</article>

<article>Results will be provided for you on your completion of this process. Thank you for your participation in this focus group for Buss Mall!
